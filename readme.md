Give your kid some Python during the Corona pandemic.

It should be pretty self-explanatory: start with `lesson0.ipynb` and go from there. I assume this will just be read by my kid, but if anyone else reads this and has suggestions, please let me know.


### Environment
I'm using conda and built my environ thusly:    

    conda create --name cc
    conda activate cc
I installed jupyter, nodejs, and then had to update jupyter to get things to work on my (Windows) machine.


### To do
Split up lesson 1 into two lessons, and expand the jupyterlab lesson.
