# Corona Coders
<img align ="right" width = "150" src=".\images\\corona_coders.jpg\">

Give your kid some Python during the Corona pandemic.

It should be pretty self-explanatory: start with `lesson0.ipynb` and go from there. I assume this will just be read by my kid, but if anyone else reads this and has suggestions, please let me know.


### Environment
I'm using conda and built my environ thusly:    

    conda create --name cc
    conda activate cc
I installed jupyter, nodejs, and then had to update jupyter to get things to work on my (Windows) machine.


### To do
- Change how you do quiz: do question and answer in one code block
-  variables and lists (zero-based counting!)
- if else and mad libs!
- for with range and some guessing game
- dictionaries
- functions
- Classes : init and properties and methods. isinstance function.
-  Turtle
- Circuit playground express
- Final -- a game

### To think about changing
- - Is there a way to block execution of bits that you want them to enter? Look into: https://github.com/kafonek/ipython_blocking
- In lesson 3, add discussion of mathematical order of operations (remove this from the quiz)?
- Explain print don't just use it
- Explain variables sooner don't just use them
