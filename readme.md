# Corona Coders

Give your kid some Python during the Corona pandemic.

It should be pretty self-explanatory: start with `lesson0.ipynb` and go from there. I assume this will just be read by my kid, but if anyone else reads this and has suggestions, please let me know.


### Environment
I'm using conda and built my environ thusly:    

    conda create --name cc
    conda activate cc
I installed jupyter, nodejs, and then had to update jupyter to get things to work on my (Windows) machine.


### To do
- Have them actuall answer questions in markdown.
- Is there a way to block execution of bits that you want them to enter? If not just do text literals and have them remove.
- Lesson 3 -- python code! data types (int, float, string, boolean) and comments.
- Lesson 4 -- variables and lists (zero-based counting!)
- Lesson 5 -- if else and mad libs!
- Lesson 6 -- for with range and some guessing game
- Lesson 7 -- dictionaries
- Lesson 8 -- functions
- Lesson 9/10 -- Classes : init and properties and methods. isinstance function.
- Lesson 11 [?] -- Turtle
- Lesson 12 -- Circuit playground express
- Lesson 13 and onward -- game
