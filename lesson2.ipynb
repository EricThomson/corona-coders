    "## Lesson 2: A trip to Jupyter\n",
    "In Lesson 0, we learned about what Python programs are, and in Lesson 1 we learned a bit about how they work, and a couple of different ways you can write code (text editors and IDEs). Here we will learn about a more recent development for writing code, the Jupyter notebook, which is what you are reading now. In this lesson we will address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. What is a Jupyter notebook and why will we use them?\n",
    "1. How are the notebooks organized?\n",
    "2. How do you write text and code into the notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while Jupyter notebooks are usually associated with Python, the name 'Jupyter' is formed by combining the names of three popular programming languages: **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**. One nice thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can use them to program in many different languages."

    "\n",
    "While an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is meant for writing code efficiently, Jupyter notebooks are more conducive to learning and communicating programming ideas. A Jupyter notebook combines the ability to run Python code with the ability to display text that is formatted in a pleasing way, so people can more readily understand what you are trying to say. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done with the ingenious, and sometimes confusing, use of *two modes of entering information*. One, the *code* mode, lets you enter Python code. Second, *markdown* mode lets you enter nicely entering formatted text like you are reading now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may all sound tricky or confusing, but I guarantee you will get the hang of it. Jupyter provides two great services. On one hand, a convenient interface with your Python interpreter for writing code. On the other hand, a relatively mechanism for displaying formatted text in a way that future you, and other people, will be able to follow. And as you've probably noticed by now, you can even integrate pictures into your markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, when teaching students how to code, they tend to gravitate toward Jupyter notebooks over other options. They are relatively easy to use, and fun to read. This ease of use, and the resulting nicely formatted documents, is what made me decide to write these lessons as Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this lesson we will go over the key ideas with Jupyter notebooks: just enough to get you started coding in the rest of the lessons!"

    "\n",
    "For instance, if you click on `File`, the first option is to create a `New notebook`, among many other things (such as `rename`, which is how you change the name of a notebook, or set the name of a new notebook). If you click on `Help` you will see a useful list of keyboard shortcuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below the Menu Bar is the *Toolbar*, which has a bunch of little icons (pictures) that you can click to do things. For instance, the little square on the left lets you save your progress. The scissor icon will remove a cell. The button that says *Run* will run the code in a cell (or display the text). If you hover your mouse cursor over an icon for a bit, a little description of what will happen if you click will appear.\n",

To tell Jupyter whether you are entering code or markdown, you can use the above dropdown menu we just discussed!\n",
